# Learning SQLite3 Python Library

> SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine

From [sqlite.org](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

> SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.

## Why learn SQLite?

* It's included in the Python Standard Library. Which means no extra dependencies.
* It's the most common way I've seen to start the journey of interacting with databases from Python code.
* As the Python's Standard Library mentions. It's a great way to test drive your code on disk-based database, this way you can focus on the code and worry later about interacting with most sophisticated relational storage (if at all necessary).
* You can move the file around!

## Tasks
